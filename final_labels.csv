18,"What we are witnessing here is deeply troubling. Everyone is worried. The conversation is beginning to move to ‘are the burned areas going to recover?’

The answer is we don’t know. 

But:

We’re in a *severe* drought. It’s barely raining and the ground and air are dry. It’s something you can sense, and growing up here you develop a limited sense for it. 

The grass hasn’t just turned yellow/brown, it’s now turning to dirt. Anything green is really sharply noticeable.

Rainfall has occurred in some burnt-out areas, but even after weeks nothing is growing because it’s *so dry*. The run off of water containing ash is toxic, and is killing more animals. Kangaroos and Koalas. Birds are dying from heat stress alone, never mind the fires or lack of water. 

The whole continent is reaching average temperatures of 41+ degrees on some days (utter insanity).

Sydney’s dam capacity itself is now less than 45%. On track to run out of water by mid 2021. The desalination plant kicks in at 30%, and can supply some 30-40% of Sydney’s water needs (they are currently doubling it I believe too. Also v expensive). All major cities are facing similar issues.

6 million hectares have burned (so far) this fire season (larger than Wales, and almost all on the densely populated coast), making it easily the worst season we’ve recorded. This is despite the barriers (highways etc) we’ve constructed and the deployment of modern tech to fight these fires. We still have most of summer to go.

My personal belief is that this may be a watershed moment. The Southeast of Australia is no longer a dry/temperate zone experiencing semi-frequent drought; it’s an arid zone with occasional massive downpours.",0

- Smoke from the Australian bushfires have blown over to New Zealand and have been clearly visible. Sunrises and sunsets have been visually different with the sun appearing ‘blood red’ in some cases, as well as hazy skies.

43,"While this is good step, it is attacking the problem from the wrong side. Before making hospitals post their prices, we should ban insurance to receive special discounts which artificially increase the process.

What really happens is that insurance artificially increase all medical prices, they go to a hospital and claim that they are providing hospital with patients and deserve a discount, it is not uncommon that the discount can be even 80% off.

So the hospital then jacks up their prices to get what they originally asked for. When someone uninsured needs their services they need to ask the quoted price, otherwise insurance company can sue them for fraud.

You can look at medical bills and see how much insurance companies really price, usually the discount is labeled as ""adjustment"".

No one, except uninsured people pay those ridiculous prices, interestingly the prices after adjustments, while still a bit high are affordable if you don't have to pay insurance premium. The whole thing was set up, to make us need insurance for any healthcare needs.

If the insurance discounts are banned and hospitals start post the actual prices then posting prices would make sense. Until then we will be shopping between hospitals that charge $15 vs $10 for a cotton swab.",0

He ended up quiting as a manager because the amount he was paid vs the enormous amount of responsibility he had as manager was so off he just couldn't take it. Almost every day someone called sick or just didnt show up to work so he ended up having to do their work too. He was in charge of the whole restaurant and if something went wrong it was his ass on the line. Which is basic manager stuff but the amount he was being paid ended up being only a few dollars more than everyone else. When he explained to me that it is literally not worth it to be a manager since it usually amounted to about 60 dollars a week more in his paycheck but now had to work 4 times as hard and sometimes even more hours he wouldn't get paid for.

Many folks are replying that pay wasn‚Äôt actually cut, and that their managers were lying to them about it. 

Well, those managers represent the company. The company said it was cutting wages. The employees aren‚Äôt having difficulty understanding. They were lied to. Say that. If corporates claims are truthful, they should have said ‚ÄúWe recognize that our managers dishonesty has caused a great deal of confusion.‚Äù

If you went to work and every manager was saying that the company is being sold and pay is being halved, would you characterizing you believing their false statements as being due a difficulty in your understanding?

107,"It's funny how YouTube slipped on this one.  They will lambast people like H3H3, Philip Defranco, Pewdiepie and others for their content to which by no means targets people to offend and pulls ads on their videos, but at the same time was supporting Daddy of 5 until news and videos were seen and broken down to see the abuse while they were getting paid for each punch and kick the children were doing to each other and the parents to them for the views.  Lets not forget some of these people who dress in the morph suits and Disney characters who do some disgusting things that kids think that they are ok but are detrimental to a kid when they actually see what they are doing. Maybe if we give YouTube a Pepsi maybe they can see through the BS and support their creators that made them big and not these people who do harmful things to people and others for views.

Edit: Lambast not land blast. why i ever thought that i have no idea.",0
108,I like how he put on a sweater vest but kept his piercings and goatee. You can take the trash out of the trailer...,0
109,Thank you Phillip De Franco. You legit saved a child from further abuse. ,0
110,"I'm hoping this will bring to light the issue with the kids on youtube. So many channels have children being filmed from birth, putting out daily vlogs of their life, essentially monetizing their child's life. Imagine if you had videos of every single day of your life put up, where it shows tantrums, things that you eat, toys you are playing with, and medical issues that you have for hundreds of thousands to see?

That's what's going on. And it needs to stop. These kids aren't able to give consent for a camera to be shoved in their face, and by the time they are old enough to say no, they don't, because it's *normal* to them. They don't know enough to say no! 

These kids are going to grow up, go out in the world and have a rough time finding a job or friends, because one google search will bring up their life on youtube for all to see. But this isn't seen as an issue. I don't know if it necessarily is ""child abuse"", but it's a problem I think that'll be an issue in the future for a lot of youtube kids.

I'm glad that these kids got out, though.",0
111,"Here's a list of things I've personally seen from their channel:

* Forcing children to slap each other when they can't flip a water bottle.  *Hard*.

* At one point one child doesn't slap hard enough or something, so Cody throws a water bottle at that child's head, causing a goose egg to rise.  Mike laughs.

* Mike tells the youngest (Cody) they're giving him up for adoption.  Not in a cute joking way.  As Cody sobs they laugh and say that maybe he shouldn't have been terrible.  Cody tries to climb under his bed to stay.  Mike drags him out and drops him head first into the edge of his bead and then physically restrains him/pushes his head to the ground.

* Mike has Cody's brother help him *destroy* Cody's room, including homework and art the poor guy was proud of.

* Mike makes a fist and smashes Cody's arm because Cody ruined the camera shot.

* Mike pushes Cody face first into a book case.  Cody moments later is seen crying with what appears to be a blood spot on his pillow.  During that time Cody is begging Mike to stop filming.  Mike laughs at him.

* Cody is body slammed into the carpet by his other brother.  Like full on.

* More verbal abuse.  It's insane.  At some point there are too many incidents to list.

* More emotional abuse where Mike pretends to break (and actually breaks things) things that are precious to Cody as he howls with laughter and Cody (through sobs) asks of it's a prank.

* Older son attacking Cody.

* Mike (after being physical so many times with the kids *on* film) repeatedly threatens to turn off the camera in many *many* videos.

* Mike created a fight club with his children and his wife Heather was not just a victim, she often goaded him on and more than joined in herself.

* Cody is reported to have started self harming (punished) and even had a fecal smearing incident that is associated with PTSD.  Instead of helping this kid mike makes a sad face because his kid is acting up (due to the trauma he's causing) and the stepmom Heather encourages Mike to stay strong in his punishment calling Cody ""ginger snaps.""

* And then there's the audience that fetishise all of this.  Telling them to beat/hit Cody and post it.  Cheering the abuse on.  They are disguising, but not responsible for what Mike and Heather chose to do.

This is a sick situation.  This is all stuff they are perfectly willing to show on camera because ""it's just a prank brah.""

The whole story broke on here on reddit in /r/DeFranco.  Phillip DeFranco covered the story (with bits of evidence since there was too much to fit into the show) in three consecutive episodes on YouTube that really caused everything to finally unravel, but people had been crying out about this for some time now.  /r/nerdcity has also covered it pretty well in an episode.

The dad especially, i could tell right away his type of personality. Just fuckin monster energy drinking, big bang theory lovin, pop vinyl worshippin hot topic scum",1

114,What I dont understand is everyone has taken out their pitchforks recently on this youtube channel yet they have a shit load of subscribers. Those people are to also to blame for supporting such a shit show. I bet the same subscribers are the ones heading the pitchfork pack. Doesn't make sense.,1
115,"Now that we're 100% sure it's child abuse, should all the people who made commentary videos with clips of the child abuse take down their videos? Because it seems a little messed up to keep perpetuating videos of child abuse. I get it was important to raise awareness of the situation when it was occurring, but now that it's reached some level of authority, the videos only serve as public archival footage of children being abused.",0
116,Being taken away from their parents and all this media attention can't be good for those kids.,1
117,"Youtube drama is so dumb... Not that I don't care that these kids are being taken by their other parent to protect them, but the major ""drama channels"" need to butt out and stop profiteering from this stuff.",0
118,"I know people are going to downvote the hell out of me, but I actually empathize for the daddyofive parents. What they did was reprehensible and deserve to have their children taken away. Though I also feel sad. Here you have two people who literally did not understand that they were actually emotionally abusing their children. It never seemed like that they had Ill intent other than to get a cheap laugh. Laughter equals good right? Obviously they know that always true now. What I see now are two people who realized they fucked up big time. They aren't trying to defend their actions. They aren't blaming the internet. They owned what they did. They actually went out and got help. I imagine their past actions weigh heavy on their minds. It will be the first thing they think of when they wake up and the last thing when they go to sleep. That is if they are actually sleeping at all. Too often the hive mind gets in this mindset of forgetting that these people are human too.",1
119,"Yeah, I've seen child abuse.. witnessed it firsthand. This is not it. Are the parent's trashy assholes? Absolutely. But I think it's unfair to throw the word child abuse around like that when there's children out there who are actually getting abused, and not abused for the sake of a prank..
